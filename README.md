## Hi there, I'm Kai 👋

🏗️ Software Engineering Student | Backend Developer

I believe that building a clear system architecture and establishing a structured development process are essential to success. These practices enable maintainable codebases and help deliver efficient, reliable software solutions.

I thrive in structured, organized environments and enjoy following well-defined processes to produce high-quality results.
